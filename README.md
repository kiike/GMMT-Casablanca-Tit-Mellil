Casablanca-Tit Mellil Airport for X-Plane
=========================================

Introduction
------------

Here is my first scenery, a mostly accurate representation of the
Casablanca Tet Mellil airport in Casablanca, Morocco. This airfield
serves the Tet Mellil region, and it's a great stopover for your long
VFR journeys along the beautiful Moroccan coast.


I have aligned to my best effort according to Google Earth. The error
margin is about 2 meters, although I might decrease it depending on my
time. For now, its status is OK for online flying. You'll see that you
can't select some of the ramps on the "Global Airport" screen. The
reason is simple: the ramps you can't select are already occupied by
your fellow VFR pilots!

Steps to install
----------------

0. Requirements: X-Plane 10+.

1. Unzip the downloaded 'zip file' into your Custom Airports
folder. It doesn't need any 3rd party library.

2. Enjoy it!


Caveats
-------

- The runway is really bumpy when using the HD Mesh v2 addon. It
might be a good idea to disable the 'Runway follows terrain'
option.
